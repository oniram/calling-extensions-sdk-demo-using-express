# About
The [calling-extensions-sdk](https://github.com/HubSpot/calling-extensions-sdk) project is a app example like build a widget that make calls on hubspot.

In this project, I change the webpack-dev-server to express, because using the first, we can't deploy on google cloud run.

I use the [Mizu universal WebPhone](https://www.mizu-voip.com/Software/WebPhone.aspx) for connect to my VOIP server.

# Build

``` npm run buld ```

# Start
``` npm run start ```
